## Laplacian Preconditioning of Elliptic PDEs (based on Gergelits et al, SIAM Journal of Numerical Analysis (2019))

This talk is for the Seminar on *Numerical Linear Algebra* course module taken at TU Berlin.
The paper by Gergelits et al. you can access here for free: [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03790.pdf) .

To use the presentation notebook interactively, you will need to have the Julia package [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) installed. Along with the following dependencies:
- LinearAlgebra
- PyPlot.jl
- IterativeSolvers.jl
- Preconditioners.jl
- Triangulate.jl

Static (non-interactive) versions as PDF,HTML can be found under the same filename.

### TODOs
- Numerical experiments under different meshes and k(x)
- ICHOL implementation
- mendelsohn-dummel pairing
- docs
